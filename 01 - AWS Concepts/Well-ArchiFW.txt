1. Introduction
Framework designed to solve common cloud computing challenges.

2. What is the Well-Architected Framework?
Helps architects build resilient, scalable, and secure AWS architectures.

Example: A sudden traffic surge without proper architecture can cause downtime, financial loss, and reputational damage.

3. The Six Pillars
Security – Protects data & systems via strong identity management and threat detection.

Cost Optimization – Avoids unnecessary costs by using the right resources.

Performance Efficiency – Ensures optimal compute resource usage as demands change.

Sustainability – Reduces environmental impact of cloud workloads.

Operational Excellence – Aligns teams with business goals, optimizes operations.

Reliability – Ensures system recovery, dynamic scaling, and issue mitigation.

4. Security
Focus: Confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Key practices:

Strong IAM (Identity and Access Management).

Threat detection & mitigation controls.

5. Cost Optimization
Goal: Maximize value, minimize waste.

Strategies:

Right-sizing resources.

Pay-as-you-go models.

6. Performance Efficiency
Ensures efficient compute usage even as workloads evolve.

7. Sustainability
Minimizes environmental impact of cloud operations.

8. Operational Excellence
Key aspects:

CloudOps transformation – Aligns operations with business goals.

Observability – Monitoring for informed decision-making.

Automation – Reduces errors, ensures consistency.

Frequent small updates – Maintains system reliability.

Failure anticipation – Testing scenarios for better responses.

Managed services – Reduces operational burden.

9. Reliability
Ensures system recovery & scalability.

Key principles:

Automatic recovery – Detect & resolve issues quickly.

Testing recovery procedures – Simulate failures.

Horizontal scaling – Distribute workloads to minimize failure impact.

Avoid capacity guesswork – Monitor & adjust resources.

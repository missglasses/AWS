1. Introduction
Focus: Financial principles of cloud computing and cost optimization in AWS.

2. What is Cloud Economics?
Study of cost benefits when moving from on-premises to cloud.

Key advantages:

Reduced IT expenses vs. traditional setups.

Flexible pricing (pay-as-you-go).

Eliminates many fixed costs (hardware, data centers).

3. Fixed vs. Variable Costs
On-Premises (Fixed Costs)	Cloud (Variable Costs)
Upfront CapEx (servers, data centers)	Pay-as-you-go (only what you use)
Ongoing costs (power, cooling, IT staff)	Scales with demand
Over-provisioning (wasted capacity)	No wasted resources
4. Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
Reuse existing licenses (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server) in AWS.

Alternative: AWS includes licenses with some services (simpler management).

Benefit: Avoids sunk costs and leverages prior investments.

5. Right-Sizing
Adjust compute, storage, and services to match actual demand.

AWS tools: EC2 resizing, Auto Scaling, Cost Explorer.

Result: Avoid overpaying for unused capacity.

6. Automation (Cost Efficiency)
AWS CloudFormation: Automates infrastructure setup & management.

Benefits:

Reduces manual effort & human error.

Ensures consistent, optimized configurations.

Frees teams for higher-value tasks.

7. Managed Services (Lower Operational Costs)
AWS handles maintenance, scaling, and patches.

Examples:

Amazon RDS (managed databases).

AWS Lambda (serverless compute).

Amazon S3 (scalable storage).

Advantage: Less operational overhead â†’ focus on core business.

Key Takeaways
Cloud economics = Cost efficiency (pay only for what you use).

BYOL & right-sizing maximize existing investments.

Automation & managed services reduce operational costs.

Result: Lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) vs. on-premises.

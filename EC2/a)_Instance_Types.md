## EC2 Instance Types

Needs = Instance Type

### General Purpose Instance

- balances computing, memory, and net. rescs.
Fits many purposes. Such as:

-Application servers

-Gaming servers

-Backend servers for companies

-Small and medium databases

### Compute Optimized Instances

- high compute needs / high-performance and compute-intensive needs.
  
-  good for application servers, gaming servers, and web applications.

### Memory Optimized Instances

- can deliver large dataset workloads fast

- loads storage -> holds data -> processes it before the computer can run it
  
- gives the CPU direct access to the computer program

### Accelerated Computing Instances

- uses hardware accelerators to boost data processing

### Storage Optimized Instances

- best for large datasets on local storage

-Large file systems

-Data warehouses

-Online transaction systems


### Summary:
